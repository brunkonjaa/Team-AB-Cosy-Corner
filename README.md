## Recent Updates

**Link updates for new structure:** `index.html` now points to `pages/about.html`, `pages/services.html`, `pages/gallery.html`, `pages/trust-hub.html`, `pages/booking.html`, `pages/contact.html`. Files inside `pages/` link Home to `../index.html`, to peer pages within `pages/`, and load shared assets/scripts via `../assets/...`.

**Visual refresh:** Manrope typography; Bootstrap Icons; slim custom icon navbar with a clear mobile toggle and page fade transitions; "glass" cards and pill CTAs for a modern spa vibe; layout widened to use the full screen instead of a narrow, centered column.

**Bootstrap usage:** Updated to Bootstrap 5.3.3. Actual Bootstrap class use (strict count of standard classes) is ~18.6% of class tokens (136/732), reflecting heavier custom styling in the main CSS. Used AI to calculate this since no other method was available.

**Page updates:** Home (fade-in hero, chip badges, glass info cards, service CTAs on a wider grid); About (single narrative emphasizing wellbeing/trust); Services (three groom packages with imagery and timing/pricing); Gallery (clean grid powered by new 01–18 set); Trust/Booking/Contact (concise, icon-led, streamlined copy and links).

**CSS/JS simplification:** Styling consolidated into one primary stylesheet with light overrides; JavaScript reduced to two shared files for nav toggle, page transitions, and footer behavior—removing page-specific scripts and unused logic.

**Assets:** Updated service PNGs plus refreshed gallery (01–18) for consistent, higher-quality visuals.
